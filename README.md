# CollegePlacement
App by team consisting of Robert Wooten, Mikko Virtano, Vahagn Buludyan, Ryan Kim and Gordon Cheng 
This project allows users in High School to be matched to colleges across the United States.  Users provide their educational 
stats and financial standing and the app will return colleges that will likely accept them and meet user requirements.  Users can 
view information from over 7000 schools as well as individually compare up to 3 at a time.
